# PRML_PyTorch

Figures in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) by Chris Bishop recreated using PyTorch. Each script can be executed independently of the others and require no data files. Due to the random generation of the training data, recreated figures will not be exactly the same as seen in the book.

I cannot guarantee the correctness of the scripts.

**Python Version: 2.7**
